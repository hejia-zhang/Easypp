# Easypp
## Description
Easypp is my personal project that provides an out-of-the-box cpp libraries collection. It provides a lot of basic but usefull 
functionalites, including JSON, Logger, CMD, Net... And it is more light-weight than Poco.
Because You can use the shared libraries or just the source files.

And the Easypp is compitible with 32bit, 64bit, Windows and Linux platforms.
